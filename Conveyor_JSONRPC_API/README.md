Conveyor_JSONRPC_API
==========

A small library used to provide control over Makerbot Replicator 2 using Conveyor's JSON API, to be used in conjunction with MakerFarm. (github.com/wildbillcat/MakerFarm)

Designed to communicate using the JSON API used by MakerBot. Regrettibly it isn't documented, so this project is blackboxing it.
